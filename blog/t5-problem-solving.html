              <h2>Blocked</h2>
              <h3>Simple Problem</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A very simple problem while I was doing a question in a tutorial was that I had forgotten to put a " at the end of a sentence, before the ). This somehow stopped everything from working.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I compared the code to a similar previous exercise and finally saw the problem.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I felt puzzled as I was sure my code was correct.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I learned that tiny syntax errors can cause big problems.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <h3>Elegantly Solved</h3>
              <p>
                As far as I'm aware, I've yet to solve a problem in an elegant way. I'll be sure to update this blog when I am able.
              </p>
              <h2>Confidence in Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <p>
                  I want to become more adept. At the moment I am having a little trouble thinking like a computer.
                </p>
                <li>Trying something</li>
                <p>
                  This is no problem. Though trying things that continuously don't work can be demoralizing.  
                </p>
                <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                <p>
                  Talking through the problem with a non-responsive duck is not very helpful at the moment but I'm sure it will become more so when I have more knowledge for the duck to impart back to me.  
                </p>
                <li>Reading error messages</li>
                <p>
                  They are quite often vague. 
                </p>
                <li>Console.logging</li>
                <p>
                  This is very helpful to find out if the function is working properly but I definitely need more practice. 
                </p>
                <li>Googling</li>
                <p>
                  My old dear friend.
                </p>
                <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                <p>
                  Yes, I am mostly fine with this but I don't want to take up too much of their time as I know they have a lot on their plate also.
                </p>
                <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                <p>
                  Asking for help when it is a small problem is easy. Asking for help when the problem is the whole assignment is not so easy. 
                </p>
                <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
                <p>
                  Hmmmm, not sure on this one. I guess, at the moment, I'm just muddling through and using whatever I can. I can see how this would be useful though.
                </p>
              </ul>
              <h2>Non-tech Explanations of Functions</h2>
              <p>
                .map() takes the items in a list(Array) in the order that they appear. It does an already specified change to them and then gives you back the changed list under the new name that we gave it. The list that we started with is not changed.  
              </p>
              <p>
                .filter() is for when we have a list(Array) but we only want the items in the list that match the need. We give the new list a name and if the item that we want passes the test then it appears on the new list. 
              </p>
              <p>
                .reduce() takes all the numbers in a list and makes them equal a single number.
