              <h2>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose</h2>
              <p>
                Pleasure is fleeting and just leaves you wanting more. Passion/flow is longer lasting and is achieved when the task matches the skill level required. It is a satisfying experience when time flies and everything is aligned. A sense of purpose is what underlays everything else and gives meaning and the will to surmount obstacles. A sense of purpose can provide drive and the longest lasting happiness. 
              </p>
              <h2>Discovering values and higher purpose</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Core Values</li>
                <p>
                  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. My core values can be summed up in the teachings of Jesus. I believe we should strive to treat everyone with honesty, compassion and forgiveness. None of us can call ourselves perfect and so we really can't expect it of others.
                </p>
                <li>Stand For</li>
                <p>
                  Human rights and equality. No one gets the choice of where, when and how they are born. Every life is precious and no one should be made to feel they are worth less than anyone else. The massive difference between poor and rich also really bothers me especially as the gap widens.   
                </p>
              </ul>
              <h2>Resilience ideas and meditation</h2>
              <p>
                Failure makes me feel like a massive weight has descended onto my shoulders and my guts twist themselves into pretzels. Hugely uncomfortable. I completely understand what they are talking about when they say the bad rises more easily to the surface then the good. I can easily summon all the times I've screwed up but I have to dig deep for the times I've succeeded. And yet I'd still call myself an optimist because I believe that everything will come right in the end. I do need to work on perseverance in the face of adversity. I am too prone to give up and realizing that this is actually just a reaction to my emotions is very interesting and hopefully helpful.
