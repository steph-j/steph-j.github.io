              <h2>Trust</h2>
              <p>
                Trust is the start of any healthy relationship. If trust isn't there then everything else is undermined. People will not be willing to be vulnerable because they might be attacked. They will avoid conflict and accountability because they are not invested. When we start a conversation assume that the other person is trustworthy until proven otherwise and they will in turn be more willing to trust. 
              </p>
              <h2>Empathy</h2>
              <p>
                Empathy starts with acknowledging that we are all the same. When tested the same neurons light up when we are touched and when we see someone else being touched. We feel it a lot more though when we identify with that person. When we come from a place of kindness, it is a lot easier to use empathy as no negative emotions are tinting the vision. 
              </p>
              <h2>Loving Kindness Meditation</h2>
              <p>
                Our brains are hardwired to get intrinsic value from directing kindness outward. I felt happy when wishing someone else well. 
              </p>
              <h2>Political Awareness</h2>
              <p>
                An agent calls me in reservation. She has a client that wants to be booked on a tour that leaves in a week. The rules clearly state that if it is within 45 days of departure then we need the full payment the same day. This is because if we book all the hotels and then cancel them then we will be up for cancellation fees. I am obliged to cancel the booking and then reinstate the booking the next day if it is still available. The agent don't like this at all and says she can't get us the money that day but she doesn't want the booking cancelled. The agent is very very unhappy.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am an agent and have a client in front of me and the client has said that she is definitely going on the tour then she goes away. Then the I learn that I need full payment today. The client can come back to pay. She does but the funds won't clear that day to be put through to the tour company. Accounts have gone home and so it will be much more difficult to get them the money. I want to keep the client happy, make sure the seats are secure and I don't want to cause my colleague trouble by getting them to help put the funds through. It would be much easier to put the money through tomorrow.
              </p>
              <h2>Musings</h2>
              <p>
                I am quite amazed with how my feeling about the encounter changed as I wrote the political awareness exercise from the point of view of the agent. I still standby the company policy and agree that we need proof of payment because too many people have taken advantage in the past but I feel less animosity for the agent. Though she definitely wasn't treating me with kindness.
