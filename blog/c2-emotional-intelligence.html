    <h2>Learnings from the chapter</h2>
    <p>
    The most important thing I found in this chapter is that Emotional Intelligence can be taught. We do this by practicing mindfulness. The definition used for mindfulness is <em>"Paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally."</em> What we pay attention to literally changes our brain. If we practice focusing then our ability to focus and find a place of calm will be enhanced and available to us when we need it most.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was also interesting that the Amygdala, which is our emotional centre in the brain, can override all other logical responses to a situation but it was found that even 100mins of practicing mindfulness had measurable results in limiting the power of the Amygdala. If we can stop an emotion like anger before it even starts then we will be truly in control of ourselves and more able to handle stressful situations. Every emotion has a physical manifestation in our bodies which takes place long before our brain consciously recognises it. By paying attention to our bodies we can interpret our emotions much faster and choose if we want to act on them or not.

    <h2>Two minutes of mindfulness</h2>
    <p>
    2 minutes a day doesn't sound like too much to ask for all the benefits described. All that is asked of us is to spend 2 minutes either focusing on breathing or 2 minutes focusing on just being or a combination of the 2. I have a renewed will to put it to the test. It was suggested that bedtime might be a good time to practice this.
