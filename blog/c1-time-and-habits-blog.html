    <h1 class="Title">Time and Habits Reflection</h1>
        <p>The techniques I tried were meditation, creating a habit and the Fogg Method </p>
      <h2>What I found interesting</h2>
        <p>I found all the readings and videos very interesting. Of particular interest was the Fogg Method of attaching a little new habit to an already existing habit. So when I do something like 'eat breakfast' then immediately I will do something small like 'meditate' for 2 minutes and build it up from there. We also need to reward ourselves after doing the new habit with a happy dance.</p>
        <p>I had also never considered taking up meditation before but seeing the results of the MRI scan of a pre and post meditation brain was very enlightening. The article explained the benefits of meditation very well. I would like to lessen the stress reaction in my brain. Being able to strengthen my memory and focus for longer would also be definitely welcome.</p>
        <p>It was interesting to learn that when we cultivate a habit the behaviour should come first and then the attitude will follow. This is backward to how I have thought of the relationship between the brain and our actions in the past.</p>
      <h2>What Worked</h2>
        <p>Piggy-backing my meditation with breakfast has worked so far. </p>
      <h2>Experimentation</h2>
        <p>I will definitely experiment with these three methods more. Especially the Fogg method and meditation.</p>
