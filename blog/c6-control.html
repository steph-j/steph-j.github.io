              <p>
                I like the analogy of a man on the road asking a rider of a horse where he is going. The rider replies with 'Ask the horse'. Our emotions need to be understood before they can be steered.

                Emotions are like monsters in the mind. They can't be stopped from coming and they can't be forced to leave. We feed them with negative thoughts and stories so they stay. To be scared of them is to give them power. If they don't get fed, they'll get hungry and look for food elsewhere. A good way to think of negative thoughts is to image that they are being written on water and so when they appear is when they dissipate. We can also think of ourselves as being mesh and the thoughts just pass through.

                The Siberian North Railroad can be used to separate a person from reacting in an unhelpful way. It stands for Stop, Breath, Notice, Reflect and Respond. In a real setting this may take only seconds, so it needs to be practiced to be effective. If the situation is passed then going through the steps afterward will help create the neuro pathways for the next time. Of great importance is the recognition of triggers. If not acknowledged and dealt with then they will just keep popping up as they are a response to a perceived insufficiency in ourselves. Reframing and reinterpreting the situation, while looking at it objectively and with humor/kindness to all involved will have a big impact on the response.

              <h2>2 minutes of mindfulness</h2>
              <p>
                I found it quite hard to think of times when I've been triggered as I tend to try and bury these occasions so deep that they will never see the light of day. I have been practicing my meditation and have found that focusing on breathing has been helpful to mitigate stress even while out and about.
