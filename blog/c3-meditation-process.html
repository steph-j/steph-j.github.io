        <h2>Process over Product</h2>
        <p> 
        This concept reminds me that we are here to learn and it is the journey that we should be paying attention too and not the destination. When the focus is too much on the product then corners can get cut and valuable learning moments can be lost. As well as causing high amounts of stress when things don't look perfect. 
        </p>
        <h2>Meditation before Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
        Meditation is a good thing to do but still vaguely mystical. I was aware that it would help me focus and have other benefits.
        </p> 
        <p>
        Unsure on how I should position myself.
        </p>
        <h2>Meditation after Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
        Meditation is scientifically speaking 'Mental training practices'. We can think about it like exercise. Growth happens when we apply resistance just like for weight lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our default setting is 'Happiness'. When we can achieve calm and stillness then we can return to our default. Our mind can be thought of as a snow globe and only when the snow is settled can we be at peace. We should allow ourselves to be happy. It is not something that can be pursued. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The mind is very closely linked with the body. Studies have shown that people given meditation training have a much more effective immune system. A life of meditation also slows down decay of gray matter in the brain. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The correct posture for meditation is any posture that allows a person to be alert and relaxed. "Sit like a majestic mountain"
        </p>
        <h2>Standout Techniques</h2>
        <p>
        Have the eyes half closed or alternate open and closed eyes to minimize distractions and chance of falling asleep.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Acknowledge</li>
          <li>Experience</li>
          <li>Let go</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Do not react to stimulus for 5 breaths. This means that you have a choice on the reaction which you can do mindfully and it also means that you are less likely to act in haste at a later date.
        </p>
        <h2>Musings</h2>
        <p>
        I found it very interesting that some of the pain receptors in the brain light up when we feel pain and also when we imagine pain. It is only the signal from our own limbs that let us know that we are not actually in pain. If we have lost the limb then the signal can't be sent resulting in pain/itchiness in a phantom limb.
