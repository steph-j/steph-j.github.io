    <h2>An analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>
      <p>How they all fit together is like a roller-coaster. The DOM is the tracks, the HTML is the cars and the CSS is the paintjob on the side of the cars. It can look just as confusing but good indentation can help straighten it out and if you're not careful with your syntax then the wheels can come off the tracks.</p>

    <h2>Boxifying design</h2>
      <p>Everything is a box inside a box. The biggest box is your screen. Then you have boxes around images, around text and icons. </p>

    <h2>Box model</h2>
      <p>The box model is a great help when it comes to layout. We can see how the box is made up in the Box model. At the centre is the content. Just outside of the content is the padding. Just outside the padding is the border. Just outside the border is the margin. When we manipulate any of these measurements in the css then the size and it's relation to other elements will change. 
      </p>
