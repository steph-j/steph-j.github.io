        <h2>The DBC/EDA experience</h2>
        <p>
        So far the experience has been fantastic. Both the fireside chat and the communication with the mentors has been very positive, inclusive and calming.
        </p>

        <h2>Impressions</h2> 
        <p>
        I am impressed with the holistic nature of the course. A lot of energy is expended on making sure that people come into the course with the correct mind set. A lot of great analogies were used including Restaurant vs. Kitchen. Are we siting in the Restaurant waiting for someone to bring us what we ordered and see ourselves entitled to it or are we in the Kitchen working together and rolling up our sleeves to learn and achieve more then we could ever anticipate.
        </p>

        <h2>Engaging with the Culture</h2>
        <p>
        The benefit to having caring guidance and fellow students who are in the exact same position as I, is huge. To be able to commiserate and encourage each other is immensely valuable to my piece of mind. To use another analogy from the video, we are all learning an instrument and are currently drilling scales. I look forward to composing beautiful music with my fellow students. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I also thought it was very interesting how most people come into the course either thinking they are an imposter and not smart enough to be there or that the course will be boring and not challenging enough. I understand that we are all vulnerable when we are learning and that can bring about negative feelings. We need to be honest with each other and create a safe space. We all have a lot to offer and a lot to learn.
        </p>

        <h2>Changing Expectations</h2>
        <p>
        I was both excited and nervous before beginning. I already feel so much more comfortable. Seeing that I am getting through the material in the time suggested and understanding it all is very empowering and enjoyable. I have tried to work my way through manuals in the past and been both bored and confused. Now I find that I don't even really notice that time is passing. I am enjoying the tasks and love issuing commands and seeing the right things happen. Also seeing how friendly everybody is has made it very easy to relax into the course work.
        </p>

        <h2>Level of Excitement</h2>
        <p>
        I am very excited to see what comes next. 70 hpw still seems like a lot though so some nervousness lingers around how my brain will cope but I have to trust that Phase 0 will adequately prepare me for spending that amount of time on projects.
