    <h2>Grid Based Design</h2>
      <p>This is what we use to structure our webpages. 12 columns across means that we can have the most flexibility on how wide we want each column while keeping them big enough to hold text.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Webpages</h2>
      <p>We all use so many devises these days to access the internet and they can have widely different screen sizes. By using % instead of px we are able to make the content adapt to the different sized screens. By adding an @media formula we can also change the way content appears on smaller screens so that it is more usable as we will be using our fingers and not a mouse.</p>

    <h2>Semantic structure</h2>
      <p>We need to use tags that make sense to humans and machine. The title should go in a h1 tag because this needs to be the most prominent.</p>

    <h2>Other reflections</h2>  
      <p>A couple of other interesting things to note from the tutorial is the css 'overflow: auto;' which means that you can limit the area that the text is taking and a scrollbar will apear. I also appreciated the mention of Google Fonts which look to be a fantastic resource and placepuppy.it which will hold the place of an image while the correct one is found. </p>
